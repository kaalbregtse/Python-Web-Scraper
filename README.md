# Python-Web-Scraper

This was my first personal project and python project that I wrote. 
This scraper is written in 100% python. Using some addition libraries such as TkInter I was able to make a GUI for it.

Other tools used:
  - Scrape.do - Scrape.do allowed me to dynamically change the IP with every hit on the site in order to not get blocked from their security.
  - Pandas - Pandas allowed me to write the information I collected into an excel document which made the output readable.
  - Selenium - Selenium is what pulled up a live view of the page. Many of the product pages were dynamically loaded so in order to pull the data I needed a live view of the page.
  - TkInter - TkInter is a python library that allows users to build GUI's.
  - BeautifulSoup4 - BeautifulSoup is what allowed me to select the DOM elements I wanted to extract from using classes and ID's.
